                  For the Web of Things exam, we had free choice of project. In this context, I challenged myself by creating my own AR Explore Game in which you can display 3D models on location against the historical background of the most imaginative Flemish art theft of all time, namely the theft of the panel of the Just Judges. This application allows tourists to get to know the city of Ghent in its historical context in an interactive original way - namely within Augmented Reality.

              For my bachelor thesis I gave myself a real challenge. This was the first time I worked in Unity and created an AR application. My application is meant for the Event sector specifically aimed at indoor events. With my application, they can already visualise their event. Above you can see a demo video of the application and its functionalities.

                  For Web development II we had to make a webshop in laravel. I have chosen for a candy sale of the student council.You can place your order online through the website and there you can choose how many grams of candy you order. We also had to make sure that the customers could subscribe to more news. Sorting by category, creating news items and making sure that we as the admin could manage everything in the admin pages and everything ran dynamically. This is the result.

                <p>For the subject Web of Things we had to make something new, so my fellow partner Larissa Gyselinck and I chose to do something with Arduino. Our result was a robot cap that drives around, avoids obstacles and can talk, etc. For the project, the robot cap had to be made into a promotional video so that we could show that we could develop something for a specific target group. Our target group is people who are allergic to pets, people who live in a flat and children who still have to learn the responsibility of a pet.</p>

                  For the Extended Reality course, we had to build our own campus in React three fibre. It was a group assignment in which Wouter Janssens, Jef Vermeire, Larissa Gyselinck, Senne Wancouver, Maarten Oste and I worked together. You can see a demo in the video but you can walk around in it yourself if you go to <a href="https://gdmgent-2021-xr.github.io/campus-x-reality-webapp-toekomst/?fbclid=IwAR1IZL5kd9ipBataqeqbzAIMT_k7ZCjAedAwu_ebOXnuhIrBlgHnNWNsUTM">this website</a>.

                <p>For the Extended Reality course, we had to make a car in 3D and then animate it and give it certain functionalities. I decided to make a chasing scene, a small game in which the police car has to catch the criminals. As an extra challenge, I also made sure that you can change the colour of the car parts. The controls are done with the arrow keys. This was one of my first projects where I used Blender and React three fibre. You can see the result on <a href="https://gdmgent-2021-xr.github.io/toy-vehicle-x-reality-webapp-EMMELINEMARTENS/"> this website </a> and play the game themselves.</p>

                <p> For the subject Web Of Things we had to do our own research on a given theme. My theme was to teach secondary school students how to program. For this I programmed the snake game myself in Javascript as well as on the Raspberry Pi so that those learning to program were introduced to front-end development as well as back-end development. In the video you can see that I explain the part of back-end development very well.</p>

                    <p>In 2020, I took part in a hackaton at European level. My team consisted of - apart from myself - someone from Spain, someone from the Netherlands and someone from Germany. The main concept of this hackaton was 'the fight against wildlife trafficking'. In particular, the assignment for my team was to design and program a prototype that would make children aware of the existence and consequences of wildtrafficking in an educational and preventive way. Our final product was a VR application called 'Pango To Rescue' which teaches children in a playful way what wildtrafficking is.</p>

As president, I led the meetings and I was responsible for communicating the information from the General Student Council to our Campus on the one hand and the decisions from our Campus to the students on the other hand. In addition, we organised a lot of actions throughout the year to raise money for good causes. Students could always come to us with questions, remarks, things they wanted to see changed etc. I took on this task with a great deal of enthusiasm and drive.</p>
